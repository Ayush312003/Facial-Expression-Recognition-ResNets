# Facial-Expression-Recognition-ResNets
Prediction of 7 facial expressions with an accuracy of 0.8056.
Optimizer used- Stochastic gradient descent (SGD)

Used ResNets instead of basic CNN architecture to eliminate Vanishing Gradient problem.

Trained the model with 28k+ images, data set from Kaggle.
